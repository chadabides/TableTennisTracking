# TableTennisTracking
Our group project at Coder Camps. This project is a collaboration between  Matthew, Richard and myself. 


ABOUT THE PROJECT:

Triple Threat Table Tennis Tracker is a real-time tracking system that uses Microsoft's Xbox One Kinect sensor. The system tracks table tennis balls through space and can determine when a point should be awarded by using the Kinect sensors HD Camera and IR Camera to see and plot the ball in 3D space. Some of the features of the application are. 

•	Track ball position on x, y, and z axes 
•	Award points automatically to correct player
•	Manual point correction
•	No touch app control via Kienct hand cursor
•	Volley replay 
•	Check for bad serves, off table hits, and double bounces 
•	Log hit locations on the table top
•	Keep player statistics for both game and lifetime
•	Store game data in the cloud (Azure)
•	Automatically configures table location with one click
•	Leaderboard for global and individual stats
•	Hit locations stored by game

TECHNOLOGY USED:
During the 6 weeks of instruction we received at Coder Camps we learned how to make full stack .NET web applications which use technologies like AngularJS, TypeScript, C#, HTML, etc. 
For our project, we needed to utilize a different type of application called Windows Presentation Format (WPF) which is a standalone application that runs on windows. WPF applications were completely new to everyone in the group and we learned and applied most of these technologies as we went. Some of them include:

•	C# (Learned in class)
•	WPF
•	XAML
•	SQL
•	Google Material for WPF (Credit: ButcherBoy)
•	Xbox One Kinect Sensor
•	Kinect SDK v2.0
•	Azure
•	Code First DB Creation 
•	Data Visualization Toolkit
